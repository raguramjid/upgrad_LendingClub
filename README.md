## General Information

- Lending Club is a finance company that lends money to people who live in cities.
- They provide different kinds of loans like personal loans, business loans, and loans for medical expenses.
- People can quickly get loans with lower interest rates through their website.
- Some people pay back all their loans, while others don't and end up in trouble.
- Lending Club is trying to figure out why some loans aren't getting paid back and how to stop that from happening.

## Conclusions

- Lending Club has been growing steadily, almost twice as fast each year.
- Most people prefer to repay their loans over 36 months (3 years), about 75% of them.
- Most people, around 85%, manage to pay back their loans, but roughly 15% can't.
- People with unverified income sources tend to get bigger loans.
- The typical loan amount is $10k but there are some people who get a lot more.
- People who choose 60-month loans are more likely to have trouble repaying than those who go for 36-month loans.
- People with lower credit scores get bigger loans compared to those with better credit scores.
- When interest rates are higher, more people can't repay their loans compared to when rates are lower.
- Interest rates also go up as people's credit scores go down.
- The chances of not repaying a loan go up a lot as people's credit scores get worse.
